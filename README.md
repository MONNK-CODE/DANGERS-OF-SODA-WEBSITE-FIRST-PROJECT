# My First Web Development Project: The Dangers of Soda

**During my time at Code Nation, I was given the opportunity to create my very own website. I was given a template to start with, but the real challenge was to personalize it and make it my own.With the instructions to make website that has impact,I decided to focus my project on the dangers of soda. Knowing how harmful it can be to our bodies, I was really passionate about spreading awareness through my website.**

**While working on the project, I found myself, googling any article I could find that talked about the negative health effects related to sugary drinks that I could put on my website. You are also maybe thinking how did a novice create a stunning bubble animation,like any good coder I googled it,while looking for animations to spice my website up.**

**The process wasn’t without its speed bumps. I ran through a lot of frustrating issues like any coder but the one that stood above all was with my links; they worked perfectly once and then stopped working . No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t seem to fix them. It’s funny how these little challenges can feel so formidable at times!**

**If you’re reading this and have the skills to help out, I would greatly appreciate a pull request! Your expertise could be just what my project needs to get those links working again.**

**Thank you for taking the time to read about my first web development adventure. I hope my project can inspire others to consider the impact of soda on their health!**
